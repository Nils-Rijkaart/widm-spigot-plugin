# Wie is de Mol? plugin
This is a plugin of a minecraft game based on the dutch television program and the adaption of it by [DusDavid Games](it.role.displayName) (Dutch). As this is a plugin that was designed for a server just for friends, it is not very user friendly. If you want to use this plugin, you will have to change some things in the code. Especially since it is entirely in dutch.

If you happen to have any questions about this plugin, feel free to contact me on discord: nilsrijkaart.
